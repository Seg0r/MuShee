## Project Description

MuShee is a comprehensive web application designed to solve the common problem musicians face when managing disorganized collections of sheet music. Instead of scattered PDF files, physical books, and bookmarks, MuShee provides a centralized, accessible digital library where musicians can upload, organize, and render their MusicXML files into readable sheet music.

### Key Features

- **User Account Management**: Secure registration and login with email/password authentication
- **Song Library Management**: Upload MusicXML files, view library as organized tiles, delete unwanted songs
- **Pre-loaded Content Library**: Access to public domain compositions that can be added to personal collections
- **Sheet Music Rendering**: Clean, readable sheet music display using OpenSheetMusicDisplay
- **AI-Powered Recommendations**: Discover similar music through intelligent suggestions via OpenRouter.ai
- **User Feedback System**: Rate rendering quality and AI suggestion relevance to improve the platform
- **New User Onboarding**: Guided introduction for first-time users

### Target Users

Musicians who want to centralize their sheet music collection and discover new pieces to play through intelligent recommendations.

## Tech Stack

### Frontend

- **Angular 19** - Full-featured SPA framework providing routing, forms, HTTP client, and application structure
- **TypeScript 5** - Static code typing and enhanced IDE support
- **Angular Material** - UI component library for consistent, modern interface design
- **OpenSheetMusicDisplay** - Open-source JavaScript library for parsing and rendering MusicXML files

### Backend

- **Supabase** - Comprehensive backend solution providing:
  - PostgreSQL database with Row Level Security (RLS)
  - Built-in user authentication and session management
  - File storage and management for MusicXML files
  - Client-side SDK for direct database and auth operations
  - Edge Functions for server-side operations (external API calls)

### AI

- **OpenRouter.ai** - Access to multiple AI models (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, etc.) for music recommendations with cost controls

### CI/CD and Hosting

- **GitHub Actions** - Automated CI/CD pipelines
- **DigitalOcean** - Application hosting via Docker containers

## Getting Started Locally

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 18 or higher)
- npm or yarn package manager
- Git

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/mushee.git
   cd mushee
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**

   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and configure the following:

   ```env
   # Supabase Configuration
   SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
   SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
   ```

   **Note**: The OpenRouter.ai API key is stored securely in Supabase Edge Functions, not in client-side environment variables.

4. **Start the development server**

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

5. **Open your browser**

   Navigate to `http://localhost:4200` to access the application.

### Database Setup

1. Create a new project on [Supabase](https://supabase.com)
2. Set up authentication tables and storage buckets
3. Configure Row Level Security (RLS) policies for user data isolation
4. Run database migrations if any are provided in the project

## CODING_PRACTICES

### Guidelines for STATIC_ANALYSIS

#### ESLINT

- Configure project-specific rules in eslint.config.js to enforce consistent coding standards
- Use shareable configs like eslint-config-airbnb or eslint-config-standard as a foundation
- Configure integration with Prettier to avoid rule conflicts for code formatting
- Use the --fix flag in CI/CD pipelines to automatically correct fixable issues
- Implement staged linting with husky and lint-staged to prevent committing non-compliant code

### Workflow

**After making any code changes, you MUST run the linter to verify the changes in code files (this do not apply to documentation files)**

1.  Identify the linting and build command from `package.json` or other project documentation. The command is usually `npm run lint` or similar.
2.  Execute the linting and build command.
3.  If there are errors, fix them.
4.  Only after the linter and build passes should you consider the task complete.

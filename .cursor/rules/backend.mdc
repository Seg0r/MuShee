### Backend and Database

- Use Supabase for backend services, including authentication and database interactions.
- Follow Supabase guidelines for security and performance.
- Use the `Database` type from `src/db/database.types.ts` for type-safe database interactions.
- Use Zod schemas to validate data exchanged with the backend for runtime type safety.
- Inject SupabaseService via Angular's dependency injection instead of importing the client directly
- Access the Supabase client through `SupabaseService.client` property
- Type the Supabase client as `SupabaseClient<Database>` combining `SupabaseClient` from `@supabase/supabase-js` with `Database` from `src/db/database.types.ts`

# Product Requirements Document (PRD) - MuShee

## 1. Product Overview

MuShee is a web-based application designed for musicians to centralize, manage, and access their sheet music library. The Minimum Viable Product (MVP) focuses on providing a streamlined solution for users to upload their sheet music in MusicXML format, view it through an integrated renderer, and discover new pieces through AI-powered recommendations. The core objective is to reduce the friction musicians face when managing a disorganized collection of sheet music, making practice and performance preparation more efficient and enjoyable.

## 2. User Problem

Musicians often accumulate sheet music in various formatsâ€”physical books, scattered PDF files, images, and bookmarks. This collection is disorganized, hard to access on the go, and static. Finding a specific piece quickly, especially for practice or performance, can be a major source of friction. MuShee aims to solve this by providing a single, organized, and accessible digital library for all their sheet music.

## 3. Functional Requirements

The MVP will deliver the following core functionalities:

- FR-1: User Account Management
  - Account creation and login are optional and only required to create and manage a personal library.
  - Users must be able to create an account using an email address and password.
  - Users must be able to log in to access their personal library.
  - The system must securely store user credentials and associate them with their song library.

- FR-2: Song Library Management
  - Users can upload songs in the MusicXML format to their personal library.
  - The user's library is displayed as a list of tiles, showing the "Composer - Title" parsed from the MusicXML file.
  - Users can permanently delete songs from their library.

- FR-3: Pre-loaded Content Library
  - The application includes a pre-loaded library of public domain songs accessible to all users without requiring login.
  - Users can browse this library and view sheet music.
  - Authenticated users can add songs from the public library to their personal collection.

- FR-4: Sheet Music Rendering
  - When a user selects a song from their library, the system renders the MusicXML file into readable sheet music.
  - The rendering will be handled by an open-source library integrated into the application.
  - The interface will be clean and focused on readability.

- FR-5: AI-Powered Song Suggestions
  - A "Find Similar Music" call-to-action is available in the user's song list view.
  - When triggered, the application sends the user's song list (titles/artists) to an external AI API.
  - The API returns a list of similar songs, which are displayed to the user in a pop-up modal.
  - The system should display a loading indicator while fetching suggestions and handle potential API errors gracefully.

- FR-6: User Feedback System
  - Users can rate the quality of the rendered sheet music using a thumbs up/down system.
  - Users can rate the relevance of the AI-generated song suggestions using a thumbs up/down system.
  - This feedback is collected for statistical analysis of feature performance.

- FR-7: New User Onboarding
  - First-time users who log in with an empty library will be greeted with a 3-step introductory modal.
  - The modal will explain how to (1) upload songs, (2) browse the free library, and (3) use AI suggestions.

## 4. Product Boundaries

The following features and functionalities are explicitly out of scope for the MVP release:

- Support for multiple sheet music formats (e.g., PDF, MIDI, Musicnotes). Only MusicXML is supported.
- Sheet music editing or annotation capabilities.
- Storing or filtering songs by additional properties like genre, difficulty, or key.
- Social features, such as sharing songs or libraries with other users.
- Native mobile applications for iOS or Android. The MVP is a web-only application.

## 6. Success Metrics

The success of the MVP will be measured by the following user feedback metrics. For the MVP, these metrics are intended for data collection to inform future development and are not tied to immediate product iterations.

- Metric 1: Sheet Music Rendering Quality
  - Target: 95% of all user ratings on rendered sheet music are "thumbs up."
  - This metric indicates the reliability and quality of the chosen rendering library and our implementation.

- Metric 2: AI Suggestion Relevance
  - Target: 75% of all user ratings on AI-powered song suggestions are "thumbs up."
  - This metric measures the effectiveness of the external AI service and our prompting strategy in providing valuable recommendations to users.

- Unresolved: A primary business or engagement metric (e.g., user retention, weekly active users) has not been defined for the MVP but should be considered for future releases to measure overall product-market fit.
